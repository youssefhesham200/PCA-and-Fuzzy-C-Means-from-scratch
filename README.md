# PCA-and-Fuzzy-C-Means-from-scratch

This Github repository contains code for reading the Titanic dataset and making it unlabelled for testing unsupervised algorithms. The dataset is a classic machine learning problem that involves predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on various features such as age, gender, and ticket class.

The repository includes code for implementing the Fuzzy C-Means algorithm from scratch. This is an unsupervised learning algorithm that can be used to cluster data points into groups based on similarities in their features. The Fuzzy C-Means algorithm is a popular choice for clustering problems due to its ability to handle overlapping clusters and its flexibility in assigning data points to multiple clusters.

Before applying the Fuzzy C-Means algorithm, the repository includes code for implementing dimensionality reduction using PCA from scratch. PCA is a commonly used technique for reducing the dimensionality of high-dimensional datasets while retaining most of the important information. By applying PCA before clustering, we can reduce the computational complexity of the clustering algorithm while still preserving the structure of the data.

Finally, the repository includes code for comparing the results of the Fuzzy C-Means algorithm with the true labels of the Titanic dataset. This allows us to evaluate the performance of the unsupervised algorithm and determine how well it is able to cluster the data points into meaningful groups.
